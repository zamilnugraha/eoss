	<h2>A short introduction to v 2.X of amCharts bundle</h2>
	Back in 2006 we released a very first version of our Flash charts, build using ActionScript 2.
	During all these years we worked to improve them. Later we started building new charts using AS3,
	and released our <a href="http://flex.amcharts.com">Flex charts</a>. Our next step intended to be
	building new version of flash charts, based on features and architecture of Flex charts. But then
	all the fight between Adobe and Apple started and all developers started asking us if we'll have JavaScript
	(HTML5) version of our charts. Of course we will - we answered and started building JavaScript
	charts also based on features and architecture of our Flex charts, as these charts were more new and advanced.
	We build almost all main chart types using JavaScript and released v2 of our AmCharts bundle. So this bundle has:
	<ul>
		<li>v 1.X of our Flash charts</li>
		<li>v 1.X of our JavaScript charts based on our Flex charts features.</li>
		<li>a fallback mechanism which allows using data and settings files of Flash charts with JavaScript charts</li>
	</ul>
	Our next steps are:
	<ul>
	    <li>add remaining chart types (XY /Scatter and Radar / Polar) to JavaScript version (until summer of 2011)</li>
	    <li>develop v 2.0 of our flash charts, based on Flex charts. (end of 2011)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	So as you understand, our Flash and JavaScript charts are at different stages at the moment. If you were using our flash
	charts before, and simply want to add JavaScript fallback, so that all iPad and other users who don't have flash installed
	could see your charts, then all you need to do is to check how we do it (in basicSamples/flashOrJavaScript/
	and samples/flashOrJavaScript/ folders) and adjust your scripts a bit. Some additional tweaking of settings might be needed and
	some things (but not many) were deprecated in JavaScript version, but you will be able to achieve the same or almost the same
	result.
	</p>
	<p>
	In case you are starting from scratch, you should decide what your priority technology is. You can use Flash only or JavaScript
	only, show Flash or JavaScript charts as a priority and the other technology as a backup.
	Check <a href="http://blog.amcharts.com/2011/03/getting-started-with-amcharts-bundle-v2.html">this article</a> - it should help you
	to decide. And check a table below with chart types, also a list of main new features.
	</p>

	<h2>Main new features of JavaScript version</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>One chart type (Serial chart) can display all kinds of graphs - line, area, step line, column, bar, candlestick and ohlc.
		You can easily switch one graph type to another, combine these graphs on one chart. You can rotate this serial chart by 90 degrees (So that category Axis becomes vertical).</li>
	    <li>Scrolling / zooming / panning is available for all serial charts (only flash line chart has scrolling/zooming feature)</li>
	    <li>Chart scrollbar can display a graph inside</li>
	    <li>Ability to display date/time based data at irregular intervals</li>
	    <li>Possibility to show/hide graphs/slices using legend (only flash line chart has this feature)</li>
	    <li>Multiple value axes (flash line chart can have two value axes)</li>
	    <li>Improved logarithmic scale</li>
	    <li>and a lot of more...</li>
	</ul>
